# Gallery Project React.js

Gallery is a fictitious e-commerce developed as a final project for Coderhouse's React JS course. It consists of an artwork store that allows users to explore the products, add them to the cart and complete the order process through a checkout that consists of a form where the user must enter their data to place the order.


## Description

Upon accessing the application, users encounter a catalog of products displaying their corresponding image, name, and a button to access details. These products can also be filtered by category.

When exploring a particular product, additional information such as price and description is displayed. Users can adjust the quantity, add to cart, and proceed to checkout.

Within the cart, users can view the added products, modify quantities, and individually remove items, which directly impacts the total order cost. Additionally, there are buttons to delete the cart and proceed to payment, redirecting users to a form.

In the form, users provide their name and email to finalize the order. This order is stored in the database, and in response, an order identification number is returned for reference.

## Technologies Used

- React JS: Used for the development of the application.

- React Bootstrap: Utilized for styling components and ensuring a responsive design.

- React Router Dom: Implemented for establishing navigation routes.

- Firebase: Connected to fetch product data from the database.

- HTML and CSS: Basic structure and styling of the application.
